# Go Ho'oponopono

This simple CLI application can be run to recite the Ho'oponopono prayer repeatedly.

Repeating the four phrases of Ho'oponopono works to _clean_ the subconscious mind
of all humanity of limiting beliefs and negative energies.

Dr. Hew-Lin suggested that the four phrases are able to do their cleaning even if
they're written down on inanimate objects, like a piece of paper.

The energy surrounding these four phrases is the same, no matter how and where
they manifest.

So I wrote this simple program to recite the Ho'oponopono prayer and clean for
myslef and for all humanity.

I keep it running in a terminal window on my machine and it's nice to look at
and be reminded of the prayer throughout my day's work.
